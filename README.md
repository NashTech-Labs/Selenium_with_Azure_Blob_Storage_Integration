# Selenium_with_Azure_Blob_Storage_Integration
In this project, Selenium test artifacts are published to an Azure Blob Storage account. 
To run the tests locally, you need to set up the container name and account name, and configure the secret key. 
First, execute 'export MY_SECRET_KEY=""', 
then run 'mvn test'.
